shheeshhhh, I cant belive outreachy is over, feels surreal like common i just started this few weeks ago!, well it is what its, this past three most has been whole some, from learning Rust from scratch to getting to fall inlove with Rust (dont worry i am still a c++ girl), to learning all about confidential computing and web assembly, to networking with alot of people, yea you can tell it was awesome.

The main task for this internship was to create demos on how deploy workloads on enarx regardless and show case ho enarx works and why confidential computing is important, I created a machine learning demo wih Rust
First month was just all about getting to know more about Enarx and web assembly, playing around with WASI
