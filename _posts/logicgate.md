I have heard everywhere that Boolean logic is the heart of digital memory and more broadly, digital electronics, and also that emory in computers and other digital devices basically rely on Boolean logic to store, process, and retrieve information.

But how ??, how does 0's and 1's store information , Actually I have no clue and i am on the Journey to find out too 

So first we have to understand Logic Gates were it all starts from ..

> Logic gates are electronic devices that perform Boolean algebra on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output. 

Essentially, they make logical decisions. This means by applying different combinations of 0s and 1s to their inputs, logic gates can output results based on predefined rules, which are crucial for performing computational tasks.

Again, how does this gates or know these predefined rules ???

The way logic gates `know` these predefined rules comes down to their physical design and the properties of the electrical components from which they are built, typically transistors (Ps, we talked about transistors in the previous)

The fundamental Logic gates 
- AND Gate: "For an AND gate, if both inputs are 1 (true), the output is 1. Itâ€™s like saying both conditions must be true for the result to be true. This is useful for operations where multiple conditions must be met."
- OR Gate: "An OR gate, on the other hand, outputs a 1 if at least one input is 1. This gate is used where any one of multiple conditions being true triggers a true result."
- NOT Gate: "A NOT gate, or inverter, flips the input: if you input 0, you get 1, and vice versa. This is critical for toggling states and is widely used in memory circuits to control bits."

So I took my time to implement these gates using transistors and switches to understand the basics. For now, to help visualize these gates, our inputs will be switches, and the outputs will be an LED bulb. This setup makes it easy to see the logic gates at workâ€”flip a switch (input) and watch the LED (output) respond accordingly.

*In real-life applications, these 'inputs' can be various forms of digital signalsâ€”anything from the binary data processed by a computer's CPU to sensor signals in a smart device. These are not manually operated like our switches but are electrical signals that represent 'on' (1) or 'off' (0). The 'outputs', on the other hand, aren't limited to lighting up an LED. They could be anything from moving data into a computer's memory, controlling power to a motor, or sending a command to start a process in industrial machinery.*

__Components__
1. NPN Transistor with a beta (Î²) of 100.
2. LED with a forward voltage drop (Vf) of 2V.
3. Resistors for base and load.
4. Switches to control the input.
5. 5V Power Supply.


Calculating Load resistance (RL): 
  since LED's operate with a foward current of 12-20mA, I will be using a desired current of 15mA to be on the safe side 

To calculate the Load Resistor (RL)
```
V = IR
The voltage across the resistor RL is the 
total supply voltage minus the forward voltage of the LED.

Voltage across RL = 5V - 2V = 3V

RLâ€‹ = V/I â€‹â€‹= 3V / 15mA â€‹= 200Î©.
```

To calculate the Base Resistor (RB)
 This resistor controls how much current goes into the transistor, making sure it switches on fully without being overloaded.
```
IC == IL
and IC = Î².IB

IB = IC / Î² = 15mA / 50 = 0.3mA

VRb â€‹=Vsupply â€‹âˆ’ VBE â€‹= 5V âˆ’ 0.7V = 4.3V.

RB â€‹= â€‹VRb / IB â€‹â€‹= 4.3V/ 0.3A â€‹=14.3.7kÎ©
```

to push a slightly higher base current, in other to ensure a very solid saturation of the transistor

since all the gates are using the same type and model of transistors, and the base current (IBâ€‹) required to drive each transistor into saturation is the same across all gates, we will use same resistor value for all the gates

__OR GATE__

![OR Gate](/assets/blog/OR.png)

For an OR Gate, 2 NPN transistors are connected in pararell with the load, this means when designing an OR gate using transistors, each input is connected to the base of its own NPN transistor. 

The collectors of both transistors are connected together and then to the positive side of the power supply through a load (like an LED or resistor). The emitters are grounded. 

This ensures that if any one of the transistors receives a 'high' (1) signal at its base, it will conduct, allowing current to flow through the load, lighting up the LED â€” just like if any of the conditions for the OR logic is met, the output is true (1).

__AND GATE__

![AND Gate](/assets/blog/AND.png)

For an AND Gate, 2 NPN transistors are connected in series with the load. Just like the OR, each input is connected to the base of its own NPN transistor.

The emitter of the first transistor is connected to the collector of the second transistor. The collector of the first transistor is connected to the positive side of the power supply, and the emitter of the second transistor is grounded through the load (like an LED or resistor).

With this both transistors must receive a 'high' (1) signal at their bases to conduct, allowing current to flow through the load. Only when both inputs are true (1), reflecting the AND logic, will the LED light up, indicating that the output is true (1).

__NOT GATE__

![AND Gate](/assets/blog/NOT.png)

For this, a single NPN transistor is used with the input switch at the base of the transistor as always

The collector of the transistor is connected to the positive side of the power supply through a load (like an LED or resistor), and the emitter is grounded.

This setup ensures that when the transistor receives a 'high' (1) signal at its base, it will conduct, grounding the collector and turning off the load. Conversely, when the input is 'low' (0), the transistor does not conduct, and the load remains powered. This behavior demonstrates the NOT logic where the output is the inverse of the input: if the input is true (1), the output is false (0), and if the input is false (0), the output is true (1).

__NOR GATE__

The NAND gate can be thought of as an extension of the AND gate, with an inversion of the output. In terms of transistor configuration:

For a NAND Gate, 2 NPN transistors are connected in series just like an AND gate, where each input is connected to the base of its own NPN transistor.

The emitter of the first transistor is connected to the collector of the second transistor. The collector of the first transistor is connected to the positive side of the power supply. However, unlike a straightforward AND gate, the output load (like an LED or resistor) is connected from the junction between the first transistor's collector and the second transistor's emitter to the ground.

This setup ensures that if either of the transistors does not receive a 'high' (1) signal at its base, the transistors will not conduct completely, and the load will be activated (since this is a NAND configuration). The LED will light up when the output is false (0), demonstrating the NAND logic where the output is the opposite of the AND operation. Only if both inputs are true (1), making the output naturally false (0), will the LED turn off

__NAND GATE__

The NOR gate can be considered as an extension of the OR gate, also with an inverted output:

For a NOR Gate, 2 NPN transistors are connected in parallel, similar to an OR gate, where each input is connected to the base of its own NPN transistor.

The collectors of both transistors are connected together, but instead of connecting directly to the positive side of the power supply, they connect to the load (like an LED or resistor) which then connects to the ground.

This configuration ensures that if any of the transistors receive a 'high' (1) signal at their bases, the transistors will conduct, and the load will be grounded (not activated). The LED remains off when either input is true (1), embodying the NOR logic where the output is false (0) if any input is true. The LED lights up only when all inputs are false (0), which makes the output true (1).
