TWhat is a Trusted Execution Enviroment (TEE) ??? üîê

TEE also called enclave is a secure area inside the main processor, it runs parallel to the operating system in an isolated enviroment. It guarantees that code and dtat loaded in the TEE are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. A hardware-based TEE uses hardware-backed techniques to provide increased security guarantees for the execution of code and protection of data within that environment

One would ask why TEE'S, why is hardware necessary for confidential computing??, let me quote what i have written down after research üòÉ
