Hello world!, my name is Jennifer, I'm from Nigeria :nigeria:, a Christian :latin_cross: and I'm an Outreachy Intern for Confidential Computing Consortium (C3, as i love calling it).In summary [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io) is a community focused on promoting the protection of data in use, by preforming computations in hardware trusted executed environments.
I would be working on creating demos to show how confidential computing works. This internship will run till March, 2022 and throughout this period, I'll be sharing my journey with you!

I completed my undergraduate studies in Mechatronics, Systems and Control Engineering in 2020 and this is my second time applying to outreachy (I obviously did not get it the first time üòÑ) I am a self taught software developer, I work with C/C++, python and Rust, I loove any thing low level and I think I want to go into Systems Engineering fully (yep, still figuring it out üò¨). In my freetime I loove reading about history and watching sitcom animations.

## My Core Values

My core values are _Resilience_, _Growth_ and _Honesty_

**Resilience :** Having resilience means having staying power; that means I dont give up when the going gets tough, or even when I run into what seems like a dead end. Like I earlier said, this is my second time applying to outreachy, i applied earlier this year, my initial application got accepted but i could not make it pass the contribution stage but that did not stop me, i kept contributing and is still contributing to the open source community, waited for the next outreachy application üòå

**Growth :** For me, growth is a journey, and it is a gradual, purposeful one in which you simply keep moving forward in a positive path. I love growing and looking for ways to be better, solidly perched on past successes, but never satisfied with the status quo, growth has come as I accepted the idea that there is always room for improvement.

**Honesty :** This simply means being truthful to oneself, i strongly believe that life responds to your honest self, not what you pretend to be

## Why Outreachy

![Outreachy](/assets/blog/outreachy.png)

I got introduced to outreachy by a friend, who is an ex outreachy Intern, Okay pause, what is outreachy ??

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) is a program that provide interns opportunities to work in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). Outreachy internships are open to applicants around the world. Internships can focus on programming, design, documentation, marketing, or other kinds of contributions. Interns work remotely and are not required to relocate. Interns are paid a stipend of $5,500 USD for the three-month internship. Interns have a $500 USD travel stipend to attend conferences or events. Outreachy is open to women (both cis and trans), people of other gender identities that are minorities in open source (trans men, and gender-queer people) . This internship is offered twice a year and you do not have to be a student to apply for it. However, you must be available for a full-time, 40 hours a week during the internship period

One of my goals for 2021 was to contribute to opensource, but I didn't know how to start, so yea, an ex outreachy intern motivated me to apply to outreachy and I am here to motivate you to apply to outreachy today!! üòã

PS: Shout out to my mentor Nick Vidal, thank you for all the support and patience üòÅ
