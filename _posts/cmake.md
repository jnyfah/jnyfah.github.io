> CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.


CMake does not build the project, it generates the files needed by your build tool

Note that CMake
is not limited to C and C++ and can be used in projects using various programming
languages.
